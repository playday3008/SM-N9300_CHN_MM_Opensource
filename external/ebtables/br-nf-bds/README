These patches differ from Lennert's patches because I don't agree with
Lennert's. Don't worry, mine are better ;)

Date of first branch: April 27, 2002

Changes in the policy will be mentioned in this file.

All kernel code in linux/ is tagged like this example:
br_nf_bds-0-0-8-3
All kernel code in linux2.5/ is tagged like this example:
br_nf_bds-0-0-8-3-dev

the -3 means it is the third patch against a kernel, but no functionality
changed.

bridge-nf is in the 2.5.xx series now. The only 2.5 file maintained in
this repository is br_netfilter.c. No more patch screw-ups!

The bridge-nf patch for 2.4.xx is no longer my concern.

So, just use the latest 2.5 kernel and don't bother with this repository.
